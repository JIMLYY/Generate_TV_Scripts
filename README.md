# Generate_TV_Scripts
## Introduction
Imagine that your job is to write a script for a televsion show. You could definitely write the script manually. 
But you could also just have a computer do it for you, which can be achieved by using a recurrent neural network (RNN). 
This project is a part of Deep learning nagodegree at Udacity. In this project, I generated "fake" Seinfeld TV scripts using 
RNNs based on a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons.  

## Required Skills
* Python
* Pytorch
* Data processing
* Understanding of RNN
* Understanding of hyperparameters and intuitions of tuning each hyperparameter 

## Test 
1. Clone this repository
* ```git clone https://github.com/JIMLYY/Generate_TV_Scripts.git```
2. Test the environment. If you have anaconda installed... 
* You can creat a new environment for this project by entering 
```conda create --name deep-learning python=3``` in the command line. 
* Enter your new environment by running:
   - Mac/linux >>```conda activate  deep-learning```  
   - Windows  >>```activate  deep-learning```
* Ensure you have numpy, pytorch, pandas and jupyter notebook installed by running in your terminal:
   - ```conda install numpy pytorch pandas jupyter notebook```
* Run the following command to open up the notebook server:
   - ```jupyter notebook```
* Run the cell of jupyter notebook by pressing shift + return/enter


## Try it for yourself
1. This is a good project to check your unstanding of the RNN basics. 
The original repo can be found at ```https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git```.
2. Use ```git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git```to clone the repo to your local computer.
3. Try to finish the project yourself.
